# ChatGPT Introduction Project - README

## Project Overview

Welcome to the **ChatGPT Introduction Project**, where you'll explore innovative ways to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) into everyday coding practices. This project focuses on two pivotal aspects of software development:

1. **Debugging**: Utilize ChatGPT to identify and resolve coding errors across different programming languages.
2. **Automation**: Automate repetitive coding tasks like generating boilerplate code, documentation, and unit tests.

By the end of this project, you'll enhance your debugging and automation skills, transforming the way you approach coding tasks and preparing you for future technological advancements.

## Objectives

1. **Debugging**:
   - Learn how to use AI to identify and fix bugs in Python, JavaScript, and HTML code.
   - Understand and address common programming pitfalls.

2. **Automation**:
   - Use AI to automate mundane coding tasks.
   - Generate boilerplate code, documentation, and tests, increasing productivity and code quality.

---

## Outcomes

- **Enhanced Debugging Skills**: Confidence in diagnosing and fixing errors, with a clear understanding of AI-assisted problem-solving.
- **Automation Proficiency**: Develop skills to leverage AI for automating repetitive coding tasks, leading to cleaner and more structured code.

## Project Tasks

### 0. Debugging - Python Factorial
- Fix the code to correctly compute the factorial of a given number.
- **File**: `factorial.py`
- **Location**: `debugging/factorial.py`

### 1. Debugging - Python Arguments
- Update the script to only print arguments passed to it, excluding the script name.
- **File**: `print_arguments.py`
- **Location**: `debugging/print_arguments.py`

### 2. Debugging - HTML/Javascript
- Correct a JavaScript function to change the background color when a button is clicked.
- **File**: `change_background.html`
- **Location**: `debugging/change_background.html`

### 3. Debugging - Python Minesweeper
- Fix the Minesweeper game to detect when all non-mine cells have been revealed (winning condition).
- **File**: `mines.py`
- **Location**: `debugging/mines.py`

### 4. Documentation - Python Factorial (Recursive)
- Add documentation to a recursive factorial implementation, including function description, parameters, and returns.
- **File**: `factorial_recursive.py`
- **Location**: `debugging/factorial_recursive.py`

### 5. Error Handling - Python Checkbook
- Implement error handling to prevent the program from crashing due to invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values).
- **File**: `checkbook.py`
- **Location**: `debugging/checkbook.py`

### 6. Debugging - Tic Tac Toe
- Fix the Tic Tac Toe game by addressing errors and ensuring proper validation for user inputs.
- **File**: `tic.py`
- **Location**: `debugging/tic.py`

## How to Use AI in This Project

1. **Debugging**:
   - Use ChatGPT to identify potential issues in the code.
   - Verify the suggestions and apply the fixes.

2. **Automation**:
   - Generate boilerplate code, unit tests, or documentation using ChatGPT prompts.
   - Critically evaluate the output for accuracy and relevance.

---

## Key Tips

- Always test the code after making changes.
- Use ChatGPT as a guide but verify its output for accuracy.
- Donâ€™t hesitate to experiment with different approaches.
